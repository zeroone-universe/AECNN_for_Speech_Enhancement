This is the UNOFFICIAL pytorch lightning implementation of,  
**A. Pandey and D. L. Wang, “A new framework for supervised speech enhancement in the time domain,” in Proc. Interspeech, 2018.**    
  
I am in progress of writing comments in this code.

## Usage
Change the directory path (such as OUTPUT_DIR_PATH, LOGGER_PATH, DATA_DIR, etc.) on config.py, and run main.py.
